1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Never could imagine there were only

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,600
Tending the ways to love somebody

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,000
Lalalalalalala

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Can't you see?

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm like your feet

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Whenever, forever

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We need to be together

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll be there and you'll be near

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And that's the deal, my dear

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They're all what you wonder

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You never have to wonder

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We can always play by ear

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But that's the deal, my dear

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Lalalalalalala

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Lucky for my mits, not only mumble

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Cause real kisses like a thumb

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Lucky for my presters, more than humble

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So you don't confuse them with smiles

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Lucky I have strong words like my momma

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
To love a cover when I need it

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I face to rise up for no other

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The day we will cry over

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Lalalalalalala

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm like your feet

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Whenever, forever

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We need to be together

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll be there and you'll be near

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And that's the deal, my dear

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
They're all what you wonder

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You never have to wonder

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We can always play by ear

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But that's the deal, my dear

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Lalalalalalala

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Think of that

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Say it again

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Lalalalalalala

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Tell me one more time

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Manually

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Lost in my eyes

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Whenever, forever

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We need to be together

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll be there and you'll be near

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And that's the deal, my dear

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They're all what you wonder

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You've got me head over heels

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There's nothing left to fear

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If you really feel the way I feel

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Whenever, forever

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We need to be together

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll be there and you'll be near

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And that's the deal, my dear

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They're all what you wonder

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You've got me head over heels

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There's nothing left to fear

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you really feel the way I feel
