30000	32400	Never could imagine there were only
32400	34600	Tending the ways to love somebody
34600	39000	Lalalalalalala
39000	41000	Can't you see?
41000	44000	I'm like your feet
44000	46000	Whenever, forever
46000	48000	We need to be together
48000	50000	I'll be there and you'll be near
50000	52000	And that's the deal, my dear
52000	55000	They're all what you wonder
55000	57000	You never have to wonder
57000	59000	We can always play by ear
59000	61000	But that's the deal, my dear
61000	72000	Lalalalalalala
72000	75000	Lucky for my mits, not only mumble
75000	77000	Cause real kisses like a thumb
77000	79000	Lucky for my presters, more than humble
79000	81000	So you don't confuse them with smiles
81000	84000	Lucky I have strong words like my momma
84000	86000	To love a cover when I need it
86000	88000	I face to rise up for no other
88000	90000	The day we will cry over
90000	95000	Lalalalalalala
95000	100000	I'm like your feet
100000	102000	Whenever, forever
102000	104000	We need to be together
104000	106000	I'll be there and you'll be near
106000	108000	And that's the deal, my dear
108000	111000	They're all what you wonder
111000	113000	You never have to wonder
113000	115000	We can always play by ear
115000	117000	But that's the deal, my dear
117000	130000	Lalalalalalala
130000	132000	Think of that
132000	135000	Say it again
135000	137000	Lalalalalalala
137000	139000	Tell me one more time
139000	141000	Manually
141000	144000	Lost in my eyes
145000	148000	Whenever, forever
148000	150000	We need to be together
150000	152000	I'll be there and you'll be near
152000	154000	And that's the deal, my dear
154000	156000	They're all what you wonder
156000	159000	You've got me head over heels
159000	161000	There's nothing left to fear
161000	163000	If you really feel the way I feel
163000	165000	Whenever, forever
165000	167000	We need to be together
167000	170000	I'll be there and you'll be near
170000	172000	And that's the deal, my dear
173000	175000	They're all what you wonder
175000	177000	You've got me head over heels
177000	179000	There's nothing left to fear
179000	182000	If you really feel the way I feel
