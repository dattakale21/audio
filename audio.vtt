00:30.000 --> 00:32.400
Never could imagine there were only

00:32.400 --> 00:34.600
Tending the ways to love somebody

00:34.600 --> 00:39.000
Lalalalalalala

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Can't you see?

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
I'm like your feet

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Whenever, forever

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
We need to be together

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I'll be there and you'll be near

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
And that's the deal, my dear

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
They're all what you wonder

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
You never have to wonder

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
We can always play by ear

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
But that's the deal, my dear

01:01.000 --> 01:12.000
Lalalalalalala

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Lucky for my mits, not only mumble

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Cause real kisses like a thumb

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Lucky for my presters, more than humble

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
So you don't confuse them with smiles

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Lucky I have strong words like my momma

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
To love a cover when I need it

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I face to rise up for no other

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
The day we will cry over

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Lalalalalalala

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm like your feet

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Whenever, forever

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
We need to be together

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I'll be there and you'll be near

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
And that's the deal, my dear

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
They're all what you wonder

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
You never have to wonder

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
We can always play by ear

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
But that's the deal, my dear

01:57.000 --> 02:10.000
Lalalalalalala

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Think of that

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Say it again

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Lalalalalalala

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Tell me one more time

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
Manually

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Lost in my eyes

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Whenever, forever

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
We need to be together

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I'll be there and you'll be near

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And that's the deal, my dear

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
They're all what you wonder

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
You've got me head over heels

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
There's nothing left to fear

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
If you really feel the way I feel

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Whenever, forever

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
We need to be together

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
I'll be there and you'll be near

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
And that's the deal, my dear

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
They're all what you wonder

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
You've got me head over heels

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
There's nothing left to fear

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
If you really feel the way I feel
